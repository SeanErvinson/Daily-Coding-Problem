# Coding Challenge #2

### Language
Today's language is Java

## Instruction
Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i.

Bonus: what if you can't use division?

## Example
Input was [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the expected output would be [120, 60, 40, 30, 24]. If our input was [3, 2, 1], the expected output would be [2, 3, 6].
